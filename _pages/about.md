<font color="#2F4F4F"><b>Research Background</b></font>

I am working as a <i>Newton International Fellow (Royal Society)</i> at the University of Kent in the School of Psychology, UK. Together with Markus Bindemann, I am exploring the role of decision making in face identification. This research has important theoretical implications for models of face identification and learning, as well as important implications for practical settings (e.g., eyewitness testimony, border patrol settings). 

Prior to coming to the University of Kent, I completed my MA (funded by <i>Ontario Graduate Scholarships</i>) and PhD (funded by the <i>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [CGS-D]</i> and an <i>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</i>) under the supervision of Dr. Catherine J. Mondloch at Brock University, Canada. My dissertation research focused on investigating individual differences in face identification and face learning. In other projects, I have used cognitive, neural measures and developmental methods to investigate many aspects of face identification.


<font color="#2F4F4F"><b>Research Interests</b></font>

My primary research interests involve face identification (i.e., unfamiliar and familiar face identification, face learning) and decision making. I also am interested in other topics such as attention, cognition, and perception. I am interested in using a wide-assortment of methods (e.g., AI, EEG, behaviour and eye tracking) to investigate these processes.
