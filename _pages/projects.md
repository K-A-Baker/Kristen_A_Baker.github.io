<font color="#2F4F4F"><b>My current progects center arount two key topics:</b></font>

I have been investigating the interplay between decision making and unfamiliar face identification. I am currently using a wide variety of techniques to investigate the role of decision making in face identification (e.g., experimental manipulations [e.g., implimenting unequal payoffs and baserates on face identification decisions-- the resulting manuscript is published <i> in JARMAC</i>], eye-tracking, individual differences). I am currently running a series of studies to look at variables that effect face identification decisions and the potential predictors of this process.  


I also have another series of projects in which I am investigating the mechanisms underlying the process of learning a newly ecountered face. I am currently running a series of studies to look at variables that effect face learning and the potential predictors of this process.
