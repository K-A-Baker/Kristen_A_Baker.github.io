I have been investigating the interplay between decision making and unfamiliar face identification. I am currently using a wide variety of techniques to investigate the role of decision making in face identification (e.g., experimental manipulations [e.g., implimenting unequal payoffs and baserates on face identification decisions-- the resulting manuscript is In Press at JARMAC], eye-tracking, individual differences). I am currently running a series of studies to look at variables that effect face identification decisions, potential predictors and whether this differs as a function of face familiarty.
