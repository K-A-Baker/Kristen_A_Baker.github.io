Face recognition is an important aspect in our lives, we need to recognize our family and friends--we even need to recognize actors in movies in order to follow the plot! Face recognition is also used in more security based settings, such as when we need to use our photographic-ID to cross borders or to purchase age-restricted goods. Whereas it is easy to be accurate in recognizing the faces of individuals with whom we are familiar (even when their appearance changes as a result of hairstyle, make-up, facial hair, age, etc) and to discriminate them from someone who looks similar, it is incredibly difficult to do this with the faces of individuals with whom we are unfamilair--leading to frequent errors. 

<font color="#2F4F4F"><b>My current progects centre arount two key streams:</b></font>

*<font color="#262e2e"><i> The role of decision-making:</i></font>

In this first stream of research, I have been investigating the interplay between decision making and unfamiliar face identification. I am currently using a wide variety of techniques to investigate the role of decision making in face identification (e.g., experimental manipulations, eye-tracking, individual differences). For example, in a recent project my colleagues and I manipulated variables such as payoffs and baserates to examine theur influence on face identification decisions-- the resulting manuscript is published <i> in JARMAC</i>. Within this stream, approximately half of my projects are investigating variables that effect face identification decisions, and the rest are investigating the various components of decision making as potential predictors of this face identification.  

*<font color="#262e2e"><i> The process of face learning:</i></font>

In this second stream of research, I am investigating the mechanisms underlying the process of learning a newly ecountered face. I have been using a wide-variety of approaches in these examinations; for example I am using developmental, experimental and individual approaches. These approaches have enabled me to examine variables that influence the efficency with which a newly encountered face is learned and also the potential predictors of face learning.
